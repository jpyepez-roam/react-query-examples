# 1. Getting Started with React Query

A minimal example that uses React Query to fetch data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to populate UI elements.

A [Code Tour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) is included for VSCode users to easily follow React Query's setup process.


## Running the example:

* Clone the `react-query-examples` repository
* Navigate to the example folder `/01_rq_getting_started`
* Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
* Initialise the example with `npm run start`
